Overview
This project provides a foundational set of web pages that can be used as a starting point for a small business or portfolio site.

Landing Page (index.html): This serves as the main entry point, introducing the "InnovateNow" brand, highlighting its services, showcasing testimonials, and featuring a clear call to action.

Thank You Page (thankyou.html): This page is designed to be displayed after a user submits a form (e.g., a contact form or consultation request) from the landing page. It provides confirmation and offers further navigation options.

Features
Responsive Design: Both pages are built to look good and function well on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) using Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach.

Modern Aesthetics: Clean design with a professional color scheme, rounded corners, and subtle animations.

Simple Structure: Easy-to-understand HTML structure with clear sections.

SVG Icons: Uses inline SVG for simple icons, eliminating external image dependencies.

Google Fonts: Utilizes the "Inter" font for improved readability and a modern feel.

Files
index.html: The main landing page for InnovateNow.

thankyou.html: The thank you/confirmation page.

Setup and Usage
These pages are static HTML files and do not require any complex setup or a web server to run locally.

Clone the repository (if applicable): If these files were part of a Git repository, you would clone it first.

Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html or thankyou.html file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking them).

# Example command line (Linux/macOS)
open index.html
open thankyou.html

The Tailwind CSS CDN links are included directly in the HTML, so no local Tailwind installation or build process is required for viewing.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure of the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling. (Loaded via CDN)

Google Fonts: For custom typography (Inter font).
